                    <p> ETC has been following an ascending support line since November 2018 and has validated it four times since.
                        Since April 2020, ETC has also made several breakout attempts above the $7.50 resistance area, which is the 0.382 Fib retracement level of the most recent downward move. If successful in breaking out, the next resistance area would be found at $9.70.</p>

                </div>
                <p> The past several days have been wildly bullish for the primary cryptocurrency. After finally breaking above the coveted $20,000 price tag, BTC continued forwards and charted a few consecutive all-time highs during the week.

                    Bitcoin entered the weekend in consolidation mode, but it didn’t last long. As reported yesterday, BTC dropped by nearly $1,000 in hours.</p>

                    Ethereum vs Bitcoin
                </div>
                <p>At the time of writing, Ethereum is trading down just under 2% at its current price of $650. This is around the price at which the crypto has been trading throughout the past few days and weeks.

                    The selling pressure it has been facing has primarily come about due to weakness seen against the cryptocurrency’s BTC pair.</p>
